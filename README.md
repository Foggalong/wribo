A quick tool for encouraging daily writing. It supplies the user with prompts from [r/WritingPrompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts), specifically the top three from [this feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/top/.rss). Then it starts a looped vim environment which can't be quit until the daily word goal is met. To finish off with it runs an aspell check and saves the work.
